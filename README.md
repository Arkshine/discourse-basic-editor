# DiscourseBasicEditor

Hi, I am working on a plugin at the moment that replaces the standard editor with a wysiwg editor. I think its easier for beginner users like myself and others.  Please checkout the thread on meta for more details

## Installation

Follow [Install a Plugin](https://meta.discourse.org/t/install-a-plugin/19157)
how-to from the official Discourse Meta, using `git clone https://github.com/spirobel/discourse-basic-editor.git`
as the plugin command.

## Usage

## Feedback
